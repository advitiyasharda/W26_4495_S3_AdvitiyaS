## 🔧 WHAT WAS CHANGED

### Problem 1: recognize_face() was broken
```python
# OLD: Returned placeholder
return {'person_id': None, 'confidence': 0}

# NEW: Real matching
test_encoding = self._extract_face_features(face_roi)
best_distance = compare_to_all_registered_faces(test_encoding)
is_match = best_distance < 0.7
return {'person_id': match_id if is_match else None, 
        'confidence': 1 - (best_distance/1.0)}
```

### Problem 2: register_faces.py used random data
```python
# OLD: Random encoding
encoding = np.random.rand(128)

# NEW: Real extraction
encoding = engine._extract_face_features(face_roi)
```

### Problem 3: No real feature extraction
```python
# NEW: Full HOG implementation
def _extract_face_features(face_roi):
    resized = cv2.resize(face_roi, (64, 64))
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(resized, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    gray = cv2.equalizeHist(gray)  # Better contrast
    hog = cv2.HOGDescriptor(...)
    features = hog.compute(gray)   # 128-dim vector
    features = features / np.linalg.norm(features)  # Normalize
    return features
```
